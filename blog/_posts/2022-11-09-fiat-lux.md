With this post, the Fr√∂hlich Lab website goes live, complementing the official
[Crick site].

The website heavily builds on the [Drummond Lab site] and
[Bedford Lab site]. It uses [Jekyll] to build a static HTML website, which is
then deployed using [GitHubPages]. The source is publically available from
[GitHub].

The lab icon was designed using [AdobeIllustrator]. It depicts the "Glider"
initial configuration from [Conway's Game of Life] and is colored using the
color palette derived based on [Wes Anderson]'s
[Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou].
