Theo is a PhD student at the [Francis Crick Institute] and the [Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London], where he is co-supervised by [Sarah Filippi]. 

His research project focuses on the development and application of machine learning models to find mathematical models of complex biological systems, with a particular emphasis on intracellular signalling networks.

Prior to joining the Crick, Theo completed his Master's in Applied Mathematics ([Part III]) at the [University of Cambridge] and his Master's of Engineering in Mathematics and Data Science at [CentraleSupélec, Paris-Saclay University] in France.
