Giacomo is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Francis Crick Institute].

His research focuses on the development of hybrid models at the interface between deep learning and mechanistic (ODE-based) mathematical models - an area known as ''Scientific Machine Learning'' -, as well as their application to problems in computational systems biology.

Before joining the Crick, Giacomo obtained a BSc degree in Electronic Engineering and a MSc degree in Nanotechnology Engineering, both from the [University of Rome ''La Sapienza''] in his hometown (Rome, Italy), as well as a PhD in Nucleic Acids Nanotechnology for Bottom-Up Synthetic Biology from [Imperial College London] under the supervision of Lorenzo Di Michele ([Di Michele Lab]). 

Outside of work, he is passionate about strength training and everything photography-related, from smartphone cameras to DSLRs and drones.
