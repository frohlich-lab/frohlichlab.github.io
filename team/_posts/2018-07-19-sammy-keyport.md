Sammy is a graduate student in the [Genetics, Genomics and Systems Biology][1] graduate program at the [University of Chicago][2]. She joined the Drummond lab in July 2018. 

Sammy recevied her B.S. in  Molecular Biology in 2016 from [Loyola University Chicago]. Her undergraduate work explored [microbial community diversity] in wetlands inundated with invasive species. 

Sammy's current research utilizes genetics, biochemistry, and computational biology to address the fundamental question: how do cells sense and respond to stress? Specifically, she explores biomolecular condensation as a mechanism for heat stress sensing. Sammy's work is supported by the NIH Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) F31 via the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS).

In her free time, Sammy is an assistant editor at the [Illinois Science Council blog] and a lead volunteer at the [Field Museum].
