# Abstract

Systems medicine aims at enhancing patient outcomes by integrating molecular profiles and computational methods. In their recent study, Klingmüller and colleagues (Burbano de Lara et al, 2024) integrated proteomic data with mathematical models of signal transduction to infer patient-specific parameters that predict patient outcomes following liver surgery.
