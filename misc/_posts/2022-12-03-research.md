# Our Research

We are convinced that perturbing cells and quantifying the resulting dynamic response is essential to derive causal explanations. We are particularly interested in perturbations with temporal precision and high specificity such as growth factors or small molecules, but also consider genetic alterations. Most projects in the lab use ordinary differential equations to describe the dynamic response to such perturbations, but we also leverage the dynamic nature of biological system to generate novel biological insights from static data.
