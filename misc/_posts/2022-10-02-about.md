# Design and Implementation

I was inspired by [Trevor Bedford]'s clean, elegant, and functional [site][1] and the adaptation by the [Drummond Lab].

The site is constructed using [Jekyll Bootstrap] and deployed using [GitHub Pages], which combines source-code control and hosting in a most pleasant way. Modify, test locally, push, and it's live.

By using [Sass] for stylesheets, the site gets virtually all the advantages of using [Less], while exploiting native Sass support in [GitHub Pages]. The site uses [Google Fonts] as well, primarily [Open Sans].

The site's source code is freely available on [GitHub]. All code is placed under the MIT license. You're welcome to borrow / repurpose code to build your own site, and if you do, I'd appreciate attribution and a link back [here](http://frohlichlab.com/about.html).
