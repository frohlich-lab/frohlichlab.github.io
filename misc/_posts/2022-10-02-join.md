# Join

We are always keen to hear from skilled and motivated individuals excited to work in an international, multidisciplinary and collaborative environment. Please contact [Fabian] with your CV, your research interests and a short explanation why you are interested in joining the lab.

## Students and Internships

There are many different [programs for graduate and undergraduate students] at the Crick. If you are interested in joining for an internshipt or thesis project outside of these organized programs, please contact [Fabian] directly.

## PhD positions

PhD students are centrally recruited in the [Crick PhD program] that has two interview rounds per year. If you are interested in joining the lab, please feel free to already reach out before the recruitment deadline.

I recommend reading [a guide on how to pick the right PhD position].

## PostDoc positions

For PostDoc positions you can check the [Crick's postdoc recruitment page] whether there currently is any open ad. But even if there isn't any open ad, we always welcome prospective applications.

I recommend reading [a guide on how to pick the right PostDoc position].

## Expectations

[You will not be not working for me, I will be working with you]. If you join, I expect you to develop and lead your own projects that are interesting to both of us. I will guide and teach you in this process to my best abilitity. I will share my skills and time with you and I expect you to do the same with me and your labmates, so that everyone can learn from one another. I will also expect you to strive to learn new skills, to think critically, and to give and receive honest and constructive feedback. Overall, my job is to help you achieve your professional goals through doing the best research you can.

We are currently a dry lab, but if you have a wet lab background, we have access to the infrastructure to run our own experiments and I would support you in doing so. The lab focuses on the development of computational methods. All methods are developed with specific biological problems in mind rather than aiming to find a general solution to a computational/mathematical problem.

I want to acknowledge [Michael Baym], who inspired me to write this section and who's writing I used as a reference.
