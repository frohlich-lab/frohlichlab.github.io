This is where you'll find the most up-to-date information on who we are, what we're working on, what we've done, and how we did it. And how you can, too!

We are always keen to hear from skilled and motivated individuals excited to work in an international, multidisciplinary and collaborative environment. Please contact Fabian Fr√∂hlich with your CV, your research interest and a brief statement of your motivation for joining the lab.
