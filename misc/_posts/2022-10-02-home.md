We develop models of molecular processes to discover the fundamental principles for how cells operate and maintain themselves as self-organizing life forms.

Molecular processes allow cells to respond to extracellular cues, but responses usually vary from cell to cell. This cell-to-cell variability drives various biological phenomena including cell fate decisions and resistance to anti-cancer drugs and is, thus, of relevance to basic biology and human health.

Our lab uses mathematical models of molecular circuits and combines them with machine learning approaches to integrate data about protein structure as well as the shape and molecular make-up of cells. The resulting hybrid models help us understand how the regulatory rules of molecular circuits emerge from protein structure and enable the data-driven prediction of cell-to-cell variability in dynamic response to perturbations. We develop the computational tools to build and train these models and apply them to, for example, predict sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs, anticipate cell fate decisions and design synthetic molecular switches.
