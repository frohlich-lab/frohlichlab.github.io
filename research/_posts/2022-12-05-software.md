Building and training mathematical models is an error prone and computationally demanding process. We are interested in building software that automates this process and developing more scalable methods. This includes the simulation engine [AMICI], the calibration toolbox [pyPESTO], the optimizer [fides] and the problem specification standard [PEtab]. We are continuously improving and extending these tools to push the envelope of biologocal problem complexity we can practically consider.
