The response of cells to extracellular cues is subject to strong cell-to-cell variability, which makes it difficult to antipate cell fates and predict drug response. How respective signals are transduced in individual cells depends on their molecular make-up, including the expression levels of respectively involved proteins. Thus, it is plausible to contextualize mathematical models of signal transduction using omics data \[[Fröhlich *et. al* 2018]\], but this comes with many assumptions and requires large models that are hard to interpret and difficult to train. We are interested in applying machine learning to contextualize mathematical models using omics and imaging data for the data-driven prediction of drug sensitivity and cytokine responsiveness
