 How and which extracellular cues are processed in any individual cell depends on its molecular make-up, including the expression level of proteins. In the past, we have exploited this relationship by contextualize mathematical models of signal transduction using omics data \[[Fröhlich *et. al* 2018]\]. However, this approach relies on many assumptions and requires large models that are hard to build, interpret and train. We are interested in applying machine learning to contextualize mathematical models of molecular processes using omics and imaging data and apply them for the data-driven prediction of drug sensitivity and cytokine responsiveness.
