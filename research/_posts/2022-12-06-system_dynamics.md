Cell plasticity allows undifferentiated cells to follow developmental programs and cancer cells to adopt drug-resistant cell states \[[Gerosa *et. al* 2020], [Fröhlich *et. al* 2022]\]. Methods such as RNA-velocity can reconstruct the vector field underlying such system-level dynamics, but does not identify the underlying molecular mechanisms. We want to build models that connect the vector field of system dynamics to mathematical models of molecular processes and thereby make differentiation trajectories programmable through targeted drugs and cytokine stimulation.
