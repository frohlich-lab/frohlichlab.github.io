The composition and architecture of molecular pathways is defined at the level of protein structure, which dictates which proteins interact with each other, how these interactions are coupled to each other and how they are influenced by post-translational modifications. Structure-based models of are formulated based on thermodynamic principles and incorporate information about the energetic landscape of protein conformations and interactions in model equations. We have used such models to describe rewiring and drug resistance in cancer cells \[[Gerosa *et. al* 2020], [Fröhlich *et. al* 2022]\]. In the future, we want to apply machine learning to structure-based models to learn how coarse-grained, context-dependent regulatory rules emerge from fine-grained interactions. Moreover, we will apply these models to design synthetic molecular circuits and predict drug interactions.
