Structure-based models of molecular processes are formulated based on thermodynamic principles and incorporate information about the energetic landscape of protein conformations in model equations. We have used such models to describe rewiring and drug resistance in melanoma cells \[[Gerosa *et. al* 2020], [Fröhlich *et. al* 2022]\]. In the future, we want to apply machine learning to these models to learn how context-dependent regulatory rules emerge from protein structure and apply the respective insights to design synthetic molecular circuits.
