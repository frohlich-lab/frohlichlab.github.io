PEtab is a data format for specifying parameter estimation problems in systems
biology. It allows specification of experimental conditions, observables,
measurements and information about parameters in tab-separated value files and
links these specifications to a model defined in SBML (extensions to other
modeling formalisms is currently being developed). More information about PETab
is available in the respective [documentation].

Users can import PEtab problems using different tools, including [AMICI],
[pyPESTO], [d2d], [dMod], [MEIGO], [parPE], [pyABC] and [SBML2Julia]. For many
of these tools, support is facilitated through the official [python library].
