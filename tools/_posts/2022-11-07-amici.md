description: High performance ordinary differential equation solver for simulation and sensitivity computation
---
AMICI provides a multi-language (Python, C++, Matlab) interface for the
[SUNDIALS](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/) solvers
[CVODES](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/cvodes)
(for ordinary differential equations) and
[IDAS](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/idas)
(for algebraic differential equations). AMICI allows the user to read
differential equation models specified as [SBML](http://sbml.org/)
or [PySB](http://pysb.org/)
and automatically compiles such models into Python modules, C++ libraries or
Matlab `.mex` simulation files.

In contrast to the (no longer maintained)
[sundialsTB](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/sundials-software)
Matlab interface, all necessary functions are transformed into native
C++ code, which allows for a significantly faster simulation.

Beyond forward integration, the compiled simulation file also allows for
forward sensitivity analysis, steady state sensitivity analysis and
adjoint sensitivity analysis for likelihood-based output functions.

The interface was designed to provide routines for efficient gradient
computation in parameter estimation of biochemical reaction models but
it is also applicable to a wider range of differential equation
constrained optimization problems.
