Fides implements an Interior Trust Region Reflective for boundary constrained
optimization problems based on the papers
[ColemanLi1994](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01582221) and
[ColemanLi1996](http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/0806023). Accordingly, Fides is named
after the Roman goddess of trust and
reliability.
