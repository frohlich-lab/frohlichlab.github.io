description: Trust-Region Optimization featuring various Hessian approximation schemes

Fides is a software tool for reliable optimization of continuously
differentiable problems. It implements an Interior Trust Region Reflective for
boundary constrained optimization problems based on the papers
[ColemanLi1994](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01582221) and
[ColemanLi1996](http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/0806023). These methods are
complemented by a plethora of Hessian approximation schemes and different
trust-region subproblem solver routines.

Users can directly call fides or use the interface provided in [pyPESTO].

The software is written in python and  named after the Roman goddess of trust
and reliability.
